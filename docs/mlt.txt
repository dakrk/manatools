Alignment:
	- SFPW starts at a multiple of 0x1000 (4096)
	- All other units at 0x20 (32)

Maximum unit bank values (remembering they begin at 0):
	SMSB = 15
	SMPB = 15
	SMDB = 1
	SOSB = 15
	SFPB = 0
	SFOB = 0
	SFPW = 0
	SPSR = 15

	(See sdSndMemBlockAllocate.)
	Oddly though for SFPB, they allocated enough space to fit 16 units in its area map.
	SFPB's area map starts at 0x14200 and SFOB starts at 0x14280.
	An area map stores two dwords per unit: Data pointer and size.
	With this we can calculate where a specific bank will be in a data type's area map.
	Doing (0x14200 + 15 * (4 + 4)) gives us 0x14278. Two more dwords after this will surely give us 0x14280.
	The area map after SFOB is SFPW, which is sensibly located at 0x14288, meaning SFOB doesn't over-allocate.

	This being a signed byte in the hexpat is no mistake: the API passes it as this, it uses signed comparison instructions on it (CMP/GE),
	and explicitly checks if the bank value is not less than 0.
